collections.Counter() 
A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

Sample Code

>>> from collections import Counter
>>> 
>>> myList = [1,1,2,3,4,5,3,2,3,4,2,1,2,3]
>>> print Counter(myList)
Counter({2: 4, 3: 4, 1: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1})
>>>
>>> print Counter(myList).items()
[(1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1)]
>>> 
>>> print Counter(myList).keys()
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> 
>>> print Counter(myList).values()
[3, 4, 4, 2, 1]
Task

 is a shoe shop owner. His shop has  number of shoes. 
He has a list containing the size of each shoe he has in his shop. 
There are  number of customers who are willing to pay  amount of money only if they get the shoe of their desired size.

Your task is to compute how much money  earned.

Input Format

The first line contains , the number of shoes. 
The second line contains the space separated list of all the shoe sizes in the shop.
The third line contains , the number of customers. 
The next  lines contain the space separated values of the  desired by the customer and , the price of the shoe.

"""
The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, but it has one difference: The value fields' data type is specified upon initialization. 
For example:

from collections import defaultdict
d = defaultdict(list)
d['python'].append("awesome")
d['something-else'].append("not relevant")
d['python'].append("language")
for i in d.items():
    print i
This prints:

('python', ['awesome', 'language'])
('something-else', ['not relevant'])
In this challenge, you will be given  integers,  and . There are  words, which might repeat, in word group . There are  words belonging to word group . For each  words, check whether the word has appeared in group  or not. Print the indices of each occurrence of  in group . If it does not appear, print .

Input Format

The first line contains integers,  and  separated by a space.

Collections.namedtuple()	

collections.namedtuple()

Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types. 
They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks. 
With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.

Example

Code 01

>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Point = namedtuple('Point','x,y')
>>> pt1 = Point(1,2)
>>> pt2 = Point(3,4)
>>> dot_product = ( pt1.x * pt2.x ) +( pt1.y * pt2.y )
>>> print dot_product
11
Code 02

>>> from collections import namedtuple
>>> Car = namedtuple('Car','Price Mileage Colour Class')
>>> xyz = Car(Price = 100000, Mileage = 30, Colour = 'Cyan', Class = 'Y')
>>> print xyz
Car(Price=100000, Mileage=30, Colour='Cyan', Class='Y')
>>> print xyz.Class

collections.OrderedDict

An OrderedDict is a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys that were inserted first. If a new entry overwrites an existing entry, the original insertion position is left unchanged.

Example
